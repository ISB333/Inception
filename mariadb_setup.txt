mariadb  | To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
mariadb  | support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system
mariadb  | 
mariadb  | 
mariadb  | PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
mariadb  | To do so, start the server, then issue the following command:
mariadb  | 
mariadb  | '/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'
mariadb  | 
mariadb  | which will also give you the option of removing the test
mariadb  | databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
mariadb  | strongly recommended for production servers.

mariadb  | See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at http://mariadb.com/kb

mariadb  | You can start the MariaDB daemon with:
mariadb  | cd '/usr' ; /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir='/var/lib/mysql'
mariadb  | 
mariadb  | You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
mariadb  | cd '/usr/mysql-test' ; perl mysql-test-run.pl
